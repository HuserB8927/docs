If you're slowly trying to understand your way through the world of websites, this might be the article for you. Signing up with Reclaim Hosting was easy enough, but now what? How do you begin to "Reclaim" your space?

##### Client Area

Understanding the basics of your Client Area is essential having a pleasant experience with Reclaim Hosting, and to creating and designing the perfect online space.

![Client Area](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/f4149616-8704-42e3-b83e-66fcaa1902b0_zps5gx7nr8x.png)

Before our Reclaim Hosting Client Area, you would need one password to sign up, another to log in to cPanel, and then more passwords when you installed applications. But now with a single password, you can have access to all of your account information & billing, as well as your cPanel.

When you log into your [client area](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/clientarea.php) through the Reclaim Hosting website, you'll be starting on the **Home** tab. This is where you can see your active domains, invoices, support tickets, and personal account information at a glance.

If your ever have any questions, open a live chat with a Reclaim Rep by clicking on the little message icon at the bottom right hand corner of your screen. It looks like this:

![Start a ticket](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/03289d4b-d8a0-4516-80eb-e3c4e7b421b5_zpsyqzx1ozv.png)

(You can also see your previous conversations with a Reclaim Rep under the **Support** tab on the navigation bar.)

To the right of the **Home** tab on the navigation bar, you'll see a tab labeled **Accounts**. While you'll get the very basics of your account on the **Home** page, clicking on **My Accounts** will give you a more detailed look into your Reclaim Hosting plan. 

You can **View Details** to see your account details, change the password for your product plan, and manage your account actions. See more on upgrading/downgrading your account [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/FAQ/Can-I-Upgrade-my-Account-Later/), and cancelling your account [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/FAQ/How-do-I-Cancel-my-Account/).

##### cPanel

Next to the **Accounts** tab, you'll see a tab on the navigation bar labeled cPanel. Your **cPanel** is your control panel to easily access and manage the files and applications of your account. For users with more than one hosting account, the menu item will convert to a dropdown menu to give you access to all of your cPanel areas from one screen. Read below to understand the basics of your cPanel dashboard. 

![cPanel photo](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1499/24375821680_dcc494feef_c.jpg)

By deafult, cPanel will put the **Files** section first on your dashboard. Note that you can change the order in which your tools appear in cPanel using the drag & drop method.

Also note the shortcut links that have been added to the top and side bars for your convenience. You have quick access to *Home*, *Statistics*, *Dashboard* and *User Manager* on the side bar, as well as *Portal Client Area*, *Knowledge Base* and *File Manager* at the top.

##### Files

The Files section in cPanel includes the following tools - File Manager, Images, Directory Privacy, Disk Usage, Web Disk, FTP accounts, FTP Connections, Backup and Backup Wizard. To truly see the capabilities of these tools, the best advice we can offer is just to click & explore. We have a tutorial specifically for Backups [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/FAQ/Backing%20up%20your%20site/).

![Files](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1642/24671562235_3051e5e0a6_c.jpg) 

- **File Manager** allows you to manage all files connected to your account, including renaming, uploading, and deleting them. You can also get to your file manager using the *Quick Links* section at the top left of your cPanel.
- **Images** lets your manage images that have been previously saved to your account. Check out a cPanel documentation article on that [here](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/PLD/Images).
- **Directory Privacy** allows you to set a password to protect certain directories of your account.
- **Disk Usage** helps you monitor your account's available space.
- **File Transfer Protocol** (FTP) is a fast and convenient way to transfer large files online. We have a tutorial on FTP [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/Miscellaneous/FTP-File-Transfer-Protocol/).

##### Databases

The Databases section allows you to create MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and users, and to modify and access to them. SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. SQL is an international standard in querying and retrieving information from databases. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. There are several tools in the cPanel Database section:

![Databases](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1446/24376064650_3750bdf5c4_c.jpg)

- **phpMyAdmin**: manage a single database as well as a whole MySQL server. See more about the supported features of phpMyAdmin [here](http://cpanel.huskerdu.reclaimhosting.com/cpsess1679149195/3rdparty/phpMyAdmin/doc/html/intro.html).
- **MySQL Database** & **MySQL Database Wizard**: allows you to store and manage large amounts of information over the web; these are essential to running web-based applications like bulletin boards, content management systems, and online shopping carts. The Wizard guides you through setting up a MySQL database and user privileges.
- **Remote MySQL**: You can use this to add a specific domain name so visitors can connect to your MySQL databases.

##### Web Applications

Clicking on the Web Applications section will open Installatron; this is where you can install different applications (WordPress, Omeka, etc.) to your domain.

![Web Apps](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1543/24303978579_fd0c210545_c.jpg)

Every users' cPanel will look a tad different depending on what applications they've installed. To understand more about web applications, click [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/Miscellaneous/What-Exactly-is-a-Web-Application/). 

##### Domains

The Domains section of cPanel allows you to manage your [addon domains](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/domain-management/addon-domains), [subdomains](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/Domain-Management/Subdomains-and-Subfolders/#subdomains), aliases and redirected domains. Additionally, you can use the Simple Zone Editor (and in some cases, the Advanced Zone Editor) to map different parts of your domain to different services. 

![Domains](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24043668124_24bb1c8b77_c.jpg)

- **Addons** act as second website with its own unique content, but you are required to register the new domain name before you can host it. For example: www.seconddomain.com
- **Subdomains** act as a second website with its own unique content without having to register a new domain name. Instead, you use your existing domain name and change the www to another relavant term. For example: help.reclaimhosting.com
- **Redirects** map old domains to your existing domain.
- **Aliases** allows you to create additional domain names to be mapped to the current domain.

##### Email

The Email section in cPanel allows you to do many different tasks with email accounts. This includes creating and removing email accounts, forwarding email, etc.

![Email](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1484/24554153492_d57f272a3b_c.jpg)

- **Accounts**: Allows you to create e-mail accounts, as well as pick your passwords for them. You can manage e-mail accounts separately for each domain.

- **MX Entry**: Allows you to reroute a domain's incoming mail to a specific server; this is used to create a backup mail exchanger to take care of email in case a server fails. 
- **AutoResponders**: Set up an email account to send automated emails.
- **Default Address**: This feature will "catch" emails that are sent to an invalid email address for your domain.
- **Mailing Lists**: Creating a mailing list allows you to use a single address to send an email to multiple addresses.
- **Track Delivery**: Exactly what it sounds like; track the delivery route of a specific email.
- **Global Filters**: This interface allows you to create and manage your server filters for all of the email that your domains' email accounts receive.
- **Email Filters**: Create and manage email filters for individual email addresses to avoid spam and redirect mail.
- **Authentication**: Helps prevent spam so incoming and outcoming messages can be detected with verifiable information.
- **Address Importer**: Allows you to create multiple email addresses or forwarders for your account. These can be imported on a CSV or XLS file from your computer.
- **Apache SpamAssassin**: is a filter that identifies spam by using a range of tests with statistical methods.
- **Encryption**: allows for messages to be encrypted with a "public key", and decrypted with a “private key” that is retained by the intended recipient of the message.
- **BoxTrapper**: Protects your inbox from spam by requiring all email senders not on your Whitelist to reply to a verification email before you can receive their mail.
- **Calendars and Contacts Client Configuration**: enables you to access calendars and contacts on personal devices. With the new release, this is currently only available for Apple-distributed clients.

##### Metrics

cPanel offers a number of different monitoring and statistic tools to help you administer your hosting account. The Metrics section of cPanel includes Visitors, Errors, Bandwidth, Raw Access, Awstats, Analog Stats, Webalizer and Webalizer FTP.

![Metrics](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1625/24554295832_8c849aa7f3_c.jpg)

- **Visitors**: Use this to see your 1,000 most recent visitors for each of your domains.
- **Errors**: This displays the last 300 errors on your site; helpful if looking for missing files or broken links.
- **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth, also called *data transfer rate*, is usually expressed in bits per second (bps), and represents the amount of data transmitted through a connection over a period of time. Use this function to view the bandwidth usage for your site; see total usage, or by month. Includes web and mail usage. 
- **Raw Access**: This is another stats function that allows you to see who has visited your website without graphics. A downloadable zip file of your site's activity is availble.

- **Metrics Editor**: allows you to choose what stats programs you will use when viewing site statistics.
- **CPU and Concurrent Connection Usage**: gives an overview of resource usage and any issues that might have occurred. 


##### Security

cPanel has an entire security section devoted to protecting different parts of customer web sites from unauthorized access. The cPanel Security section includes SSH Access, IP Blocker, SSL/TLS, Hotlink Protection, Leech Protection and ModSecurity.

![Security](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1528/24646033316_a8fb4fd450_c.jpg)

- **Hotlink Protection**: prevents other websites from directly linking to files on your website.
- **Leech Protection**: prevents your users from giving out or publicly posting their passwords to a restricted area of your site
- **ModSecurity**: protects your website from various attacks using a web application firewall, provides additional tools to monitor your Apache web server.
