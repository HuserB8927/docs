Depending on when your domain name was registered you have a few options for changing it. Reclaim Hosting offers a **24 Hour No Regrets Policy** allowing you to request a different domain name for any reason within the first 24 hours of signup. Perhaps you left a typo in there or suddenly deciding to go in a different direction, no matter the reason we can take care of it. To take advantage of this [contact Reclaim Hosting support](mailto:support@reclaimhosting.com) with the domain name you would like and we'll modify the account for you.

If you wish to modify your domain name and it has been more than a day since signing up, you can request a new domain for the cost of a single domain registration, **$12**.

Reclaim Hosting will swap it into your account and you won't lose any of the work you've done up until that point.
