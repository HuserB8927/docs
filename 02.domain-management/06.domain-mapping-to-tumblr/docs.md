Let's say that you've registered a domain with Reclaim Hosting, and you've mapped that domain to to your Wordpress website. Now, maybe you're interested in pulling data from an outside source onto your website while still using your domain. This is done using [subdomains](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/Domain-Management/Subdomains-and-Subfolders/#subdomains). 

**The idea is fairly simple**: create a subdomain, then redirect that subdomain to the outside source that you'd like to pull in. 

For purposes of this article, let's look at mapping your subdomain to your [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) website. Start by logging into your cPanel, and clicking on *Subdomains* under the Domains section of your cPanel dashboard.

From there, you're going to want to create a subdomain.

1. Type the subdomain that you want in box 1. 
2. Click anywhere outside of box 1 and you'll see box 3 automatically fill itself in.
3. If you have multiple domains registered, use the dropdown menu in box 2 to select the correct domain. 
4. Click *Create*.

You'll be taken to a page that says "Success: "tumblr.yourdomain.com" has been created." Click *Go Back*.

Scroll down a click *Manage Direction* of the subdomain that you've just created.

Type in the web address of your Tumblr site and click *save*.

As a final step, test out the redirection by typing in your recently created subdomain into your web browser.
