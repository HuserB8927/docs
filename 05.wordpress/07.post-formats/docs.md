Recent versions of WordPress have built out a new "post format" feature which, if you are using a theme that supports it, will style post formats differently depending on what they are. The formats that are built-in to WordPress (and are available for theme developers to use) are the following:

* aside - Similar to a Facebook note update.
* image - A single image.
* video - A single video.
* quote - A quotation.
* link - A link to another site.
* gallery - A gallery of images.
* status - A short status update, similar to a Twitter status update.
* audio - An audio file.
* chat - A chat transcript.

Those of you familiar with [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) may recognize this general approach.

For the most part, post formats are designed as a way to style a site (and customize styling depending on the kind of content that is being displayed). They have no special functionality, and their use depends entirely upon the theme you are using. Many older themes, for example, do not recognize post formats.
