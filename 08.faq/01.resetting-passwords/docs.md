##### I can't remember my password. 

The hardest part about this is understanding which password you're forgetting/needing to reset. Reclaim Hosting has simplified this process as much as possible by allowing you to access your Client Area and cPanel with one username and password. This way for general logging in purposes, you only really need to remember one set of credentials. 


##### Accessing Client Area & cPanel
If you ever forget this username/password, no worries. You can always reset it by clicking the **Forgot Password?** button on the Client Area login screen found [here](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/clientarea.php).

That will direct you to a page where you can fill in your registered email address (and answer your account security question if you set one).

From there you will be sent instructions to reset your password. **Tip**: Make sure this email isn't sitting in your inbox junk folder!

##### FTP cPanel Password
When transferring large files using FTP, you'll be required to access your cPanel username/password separately. If you don't know these credentials offhand, you can easily access them through your client area. Click on **My Accounts** on the navigation bar, and select the option to **View Details** of your domain.

From there, click **Change Password**. Although you won't be actually changing your cPanel username & password, they'll be listed at the top of that page.
