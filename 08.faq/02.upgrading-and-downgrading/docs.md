Absolutely! Our advice is to start small and if you need to you can upgrade later. You'll be pro-rated the difference between the two plans based on where in the billing cycle your account falls. To upgrade your account click **Active Accounts** and then click the dropdown and select **Upgrade/Downgrade** to change your hosting plan.

However if your needs change and you realize you'd like a downgrade, that's no problem! Clicking the same **Upgrade/Downgrade** button mentioned above will allow you to select a smaller hosting plan. To see if you're eligible for a refund, check out our refund policy [here](https://reclaimhosting.com/refund-policy/).
