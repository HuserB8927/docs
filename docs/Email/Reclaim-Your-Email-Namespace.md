I’ve been working on some tutorials for “Documentation December” at Reclaim Hosting. One of the simpler, albeit powerful, tools available through CPanel is **Email Forwarding**. This enables you to create an email address using you domain, such as mail@jimgroom.com or support@jimgroom.com, etc. You can create just about any email address you want off of your domain. What’s more, you can forward any and all mail to that address to your Gmail, Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc.

Why forward mail? Shouldn’t we RECLAIM THE EMAIL!  In an ideal world, absolutely. But in reality managing your own email via CPanel is a royal pain in the culo. It’s a lot of overhead, and the spam management can take over your life. There may be a better solution in the near future, but in the meantime at least you can reclaim an email namespace like mail@jimgroom.com. And if even if there isn’t a solution in the near future to hosting email more easily, you should still be able to carry you email address seamlessly from service to service.

Anyway, here’s how….

**Forwarding Your Email**

Under the email section click on the **Forwarders** icon.

Once there, click on the **“Add Forwarder”** button.

Now you can choose your email prefix, such as mail, support, help, etc. and then add the email address you want this email to be forwarded to. The click “Add Forwarder.”

After you added the Forwarder, you should double check your addresses, and you should be all set.
