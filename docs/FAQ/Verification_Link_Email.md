###Verification Link Email
<br />
When you first sign up for your Reclaim Hosting account, you will see the following warning before entering your contact details:

```
Please note: EDU email addresses often flag emails from our domain registrar as spam.
For best results, use a personal email address such as a Gmail account.
```
We highly recommend that you use a personal email account, such as Gmail, in order to guarantee the receival of important Reclaim Hosting emails. 

One of the emails that will be sent to you contains a **verification link to verify your email address**. It will look something like this:

<br />

Until this is done you will see a yellow **warning** banner at the top of your Client Area homepage: 

![Pending verification screenshot](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/46d80111-482a-4e30-8851-0d1ca20893ba_zpsts0i5d7y.png)

```
Greetings! We haven't received a response to the verification email sent to (your
email). New regulations dicated by ICANN, the organizational body for all domain 
registrations, require the primary contact's email address be verified within 14 days
of registration. If the email address is not verified before (your relative date) 
the domain name with be deactivated.
```

#####I can't find the verification link email in my inbox.

As mentioned above, new Reclaim users have 15 days to verify their email address or their account will be suspended. If you can't find the email, click the **Resend Email** to receive another copy. (Make sure to check your spam folders!)

If you still aren't receiving the email, contact support with a personal email address that we can use to update your contact details and resend the verification link email.

#####My account was suspended. 
If you've waited for your account to be suspended before taking care of this, no worries. Your website content hasn't disappeared, you just wont be able to access it until you verify your email address.

#####I just verified my email address, but I'm still not seeing my website content. 
This is to be expected. Because your domain was suspended, it could take up to a few hours to get everything working again.

As always, if you feel like something else may be going on, open a support ticket & let us know!
