If you're slowly trying to understand your way through the world of websites, this might be the article for you. Signing up with Reclaim Hosting was easy enough, but now what? How do you begin to "Reclaim" your space?

##### Client Area

Understanding the basics of your Client Area is essential having a pleasant experience with Reclaim Hosting, and to creating and designing the perfect online space.

![Client Area](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/f4149616-8704-42e3-b83e-66fcaa1902b0_zps5gx7nr8x.png)

Before our Reclaim Hosting Client Area, you would need one password to sign up, another to login to cPanel, and then more passwords when you installed applications. But now with a single password, you can have access to all of your account information & billing, as well as your cPanel.

When you log into your [client area](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/clientarea.php) through the Reclaim Hosting website, you'll be starting on the **Home** tab. This is where you can see your active domains, invoices, support tickets, and personal account information at a glance.

If your ever have any questions, open a live chat with a Reclaim Rep by clicking on the little message icon at the bottom right hand corner of your screen. It looks like this:

![Start a ticket](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/03289d4b-d8a0-4516-80eb-e3c4e7b421b5_zpsyqzx1ozv.png)

(You can also see your previous conversations with a Reclaim Rep under the **Support** tab on the navigation bar.)

To the right of the **Home** tab on the navigation bar, you'll see a tab labeled **Accounts**. While you'll get the very basics of your account on the **Home** page, clicking on **My Accounts** will give you a more detailed look into your Reclaim Hosting plan. 

You can **View Details** to see your account details, change the password for your product plan, and manage your account actions. See more on upgrading/downgrading your account [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/FAQ/Can-I-Upgrade-my-Account-Later/), and cancelling your account [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/FAQ/How-do-I-Cancel-my-Account/).

##### cPanel

Next to the **Accounts** tab, you'll see a tab on the navigation bar labeled cPanel. Your **cPanel** is your control panel that lets you easily access and manage the files and applications of your account. For users with more than one hosting account, the menu item will convert to a dropdown menu so you have access to every cPanel area youâ€™re a user on from one screen. Read below to understand the basics of your cPanel dashboard.

##### Web Applications

![Web Apps](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/3757af3e-9097-49b7-9a05-65b43d53c56e_zpsdhvua5k2.png)

Every users' cPanel will look a tad different depending on what applications you've installed. For instance, [users working through Wordpress](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/WordPress/Adding-Themes/#adding-themes) will need to install the Wordpress application, while those [working with Omeka](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/Omeka/Working-with-Omeka/) will need to install the Omeka application.

##### Domains

The Domains section of cPanel allows you to manage your addon domains, [subdomains](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/Domain-Management/Subdomains-and-Subfolders/#subdomains), aliases, and redirected domains. Additionally, you can use the Simple Zone Editor and Advanced Zone Editor to map different parts of your domain on different services. 

![Domains](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/5ec6707d-8e9f-40a1-a273-887f88f67f2e_zps9m7xajq5.png)

- **Addons** act as second website with its own unique content, but you are required to register the new domain name before you can host it. For example: www.seconddomain.com
- **Subdomains** act as a second website with its own unique content without having to register a new domain name. Instead, you use your existing domain name and change the www to another relavant term. For example: help.reclaimhosting.com
- **Redirects** map old domains to your existing domain.
- **Aliases** allows you to create additional domain names to be mapped to the current domain.

##### Files

The Files section in cPanel includes the following tools - File Manager, Images, Directory Privacy, Disk Usage, Web Disk, FTP accounts, FTP Connections, Backup, Backup Wizard, and R1Soft Restore Backup. To truly see the capabilities of these tools, the best advice we can offer is just to click & explore. We have a tutorial specifically for Backups [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/FAQ/Backing%20up%20your%20site/).

![Files](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/ce307411-f600-4202-b78a-51cfeb530c15_zps86mr2fup.png)

##### Databases

The Databases section allows you to create MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and users, and to  modify and access to them. SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. SQL is an international standard in querying and retrieving information from databases. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. There are several tools in the cPanel Database section:

![Databases](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/044235dc-484e-4f5c-be9d-1adefd145e1e_zpsxovjasdc.png)

- **MySQL Database** & **MySQL Database Wizard**: allows you to store and manage large amounts of information over the web; these are essential to running web-based applications, for example: bulletin boards, content management systems, and online shopping carts. The Wizard guides you through the setup of a MySQL database and user privileges.

Use this function to view the bandwidth usage for your site; see total usage, or by month. Includes web and mail usage.

![Security](http://i1071.photobucket.com/albums/u516/Brumface/addfece4-8eac-4b33-8536-2ff50c39b76e_zpsc0dtd3ls.png)
