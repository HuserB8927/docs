WordPress is by far the most popular software to drive new websites on Reclaim Hosting and for good reason, it powers over 25% of all websites on the internet and remains a solid platform for building out a space on the web. Reclaim Hosting provides you with an automated installer for WordPress, making it dead simple to get a site up and running. Here's how to get started:

To begin, log in to the client area at [https://portal.reclaimhosting.com](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com) with your email address and the password you set during the order process.

Your client area provides a dashboard to access account information, latest news, invoices, and access to cPanel (the control panel for your hosting account). Click cPanel to access your hosting account tools.

You'll find a variety of tools at your disposal in the cPanel interface. For now we'll be using the automated WordPress installer so click on the WordPress icon under Featured Applications.

You'll be asked a few pieces of information to install WordPress. Choose the Location for the install which can either be the main domain or any subdomain in your account. If you choose to install into a directory under your domain be aware your site will have a URL with that directory as a suffix of the URL (ie. yourdomain.com/blog)

By default our automated installer will add the latest copy of WordPress to your site and keep it up-to-date automatically. We recommend you leave these settings at the default.

Finally, choose a username and password for the site (you can change any information automatically placed here) as well as what features you'd like enabled on your site. If you have advanced needs you can modify options under the Advanced section but otherwise click Install at the bottom to start the installation.

When it's complete you'll be presented with links to access both the homepage as well as the Administration area for WordPress (the Dashboard). Our installer will automatically sign you into your WordPress site when you access it via the admin link provided on this screen.
