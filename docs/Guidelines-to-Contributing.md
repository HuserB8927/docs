##Guidelines to Contributing

* Pull requests should only include additions or modifications to Markdown files within the **docs** folder on the **master** branch.
* Contributions that are licensed for reuse with attribution must include the attribution at the bottom of the document.
* Tutorials and Guides should be rethought as deconstructed documents. Rather than writing a tutorial on how to write a WordPress post, consider creating separate documents for **Post Editing**, **Adding Media**, **Including Categories and Tags in Posts** (actually that could be two documents), and **Publishing Options**. Deconstructed documents allow for the ability to reuse parts and remix documents into new tutorials and guides easily (and more generally shorter guides are easier to read).

##Style Guide
###Grammar

Documents should be written from the second-person point of view. Example: "When you reach the confirmation screen, click OK."

First-person language should be eliminated to enable easier reuse within different organizations and contexts.

###Images

Images should be hosted externally to make reuse as easy as possible. We prefer to use Imgur because uploading and embedding is easy, but any service that is fast and reliable without ads is fine.

Thumbnails within search results can be included by adding the following tag to the bottom of your document with the image linked:
```<meta property="st:image" content="http://i.imgur.com/img.png">```

Screenshots should only include the necessary UI elements to understand the context of the action taking place. Never include browser chrome or OS elements unless they are necessary to gain meaning from the image.

Annotations should be simple arrows, highlighting masks, or outlines. Never include text annotations within an image.

###Formatting

Use **bold text** to indicate buttons on the screen that should be clicked or locations of the screen to focus on.

Use *italics* to define concepts like *File Transfer Protocol* and acronymns like *ICAAN*. 

Use `code` tags to indicate things the user should type or the output of any commands from a shell prompt.
