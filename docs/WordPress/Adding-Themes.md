A powerful benefit of building your WordPress site on Reclaim Hosting is the freedom you have to install and customize any theme and adding them couldn't be easier. From your WordPress dashboard click **Appearance > Themes** to view the themes you currently have installed. You can have several different themes installed at the same time and switch between them. This list is looking pretty bare so let's add a few more in here. Clicking **Add New** will allow you to search and browse the thousands of themes available in the WordPress directory. When you find one that you like go ahead and click **Install** to add it to your list. You can choose to activate that theme now, or you can go back and browse for some more themes.

Perhaps you purchased a theme from someone and you want to add it to your site. To upload a theme you'll still click **Add New** but then you'll click **Upload Theme**. Select your zip file that you downloaded to your computer previously and it will begin uploading. Once it's done you can activate the theme and get started customizing it. To experience the power of owning your own domain and building with WordPress go to reclaimhosting.com.
