When you build your WordPress site on Reclaim Hosting you're not limited to the stock set of tools that come with the software, there's an entire ecosystem of plugins for you to take advantage of. What are plugins? Imagine you just bought a car and you really love it, but you didn't get the leather interior upgrade and you kinda wish you'd got a sunroof. Plugins for WordPress allow you to add functionality to your site that doesn't normally come in a standard install. Wanna have all the new posts get sent to Facebook or Twitter? There's a plugin for that. Wanna build a contact form? Well, there's a plugin for that.

Adding plugins is a snap. From your WordPress Dashboard, go to the **Plugins** page. This lists all of the plugins you currently have installed as well as which ones are turned on. Clicking **Add New** will connect you with the WordPress Plugin Directory where you can search and browse from over 35,000 plugins to install and customize. Find the one you like and it's as simple as clicking **Install** and **Activate** and you're ready to start setting it up. Installing plugins from your computer is also easy, just go to **Add New** and click **Upload Plugin** to upload the plugin from your computer and install it.
